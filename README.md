# Feed Reader Testing

This is my fifth Udacity project of FEND, a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, which is tested with [Jasmine 2.1.2](http://jasmine.github.io/).

## Installation Requirements

To run this application, you need to download or clone this repository to your computer and run the `index.html`, which is inside the `js` directory, in your browser.
If you want to make changes to the test suite, the main application for that is `feedreader.js`, which is inside `jasmine>lib>jasmine-2.1.2>spec`.[See image bellow].
